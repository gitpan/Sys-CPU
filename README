    number of CPU's supported.

SYNOPSIS

      $number_of_cpus = Sys::CPU::cpu_count();
      printf("I have %d CPU's\n",$number_of_cpus);
      print "  Speed : ",Sys::CPU::cpu_clock(),"\n";
      print "  Type  : ",Sys::CPU::cpu_type(),"\n";

DESCRIPTION
    In responce to a post on perlmonks.org, a module for counting the number
    of CPU's on a system. Support has now also been added for type of CPU
    and clock speed. While much of the code is from UNIX::Processors, win32
    support has been added (but not tested).
